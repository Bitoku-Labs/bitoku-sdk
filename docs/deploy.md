# How to Use The Bitoku SDK

## Installing IDE

You can use any IDE to include Visaul Studio and Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is provided free from Microsoft. To install click [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Installing Rust

Bitoku is proud to use Rust as its preferred langauge. Rust is a powerful programming language often chosen for high priority applications that require a high degree of correctness. To install, click [RustUp](https://rustup.rs/).

## Configuring Rust in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code requires some configuration to work with the Rust programming langauge. Please reference the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust) documentation for additional details.

## Next Steps...Contributing

We use the fork and pull workflow to handle our code and contributions to our codebase which eventually lead to our CICD pipline. To contribute to this project and repository, please follow the next steps.

1. Create a fork of the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Add to and make edits to the where you want to contribute.
3. Create a pull request from the fork to propose the changes you made to the original repository owner.
4. If the repository owner likes you work and it passes all QAQC checks (perofmance, security, etc.), the owner will merge your changes into the official repository.

### Required Git Commands
1. Create a fork - Simply click on the "fork" button.
2. Clone your fork - The clone command creates a local Git repository on your computer from your account's repository.
3. Modify code, documentation, etc. Take care to provide copious amounts of notes allowing others to check your work easier.
4. Push your changes.
5. Create a pull request.

Once your work has been accepted, sync your fork.
